The Skinny: I'm Wes Bos, a full stack web developer and designer from Hamilton, Canada. I love to share what I know through my training products, [Wes'][1] teaching and speaking at conferences. I've been creating on the web for around 9 years and have become pretty good at it. I hang out on Twitter and would love to meet you!
